The majority of passive systems utilised in remote sensing applications function within the visible, infrared, thermal infrared, and microwave segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples include: human eye, camera, satellite sensor, etc.\n\n\n\n(“Passive Sensors” 2024).\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Active\nActive sensors emit a burst of energy and analyse alterations in the returning signal. The majority of active sensors operate within the microwave segment of the electromagnetic spectrum, enabling them to penetrate the atmosphere in various conditions, e.g. clouds. Examples include: LiDAR, X-Ray, etc.\n\n\n\n(“Active Sensors” 2024)."

Various radiation types vary in wavelength and occupy different segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. Sensors are capable of capturing these diverse wavelengths, thereby offering varying information types and operating within distinct limitations."

Through this technology, DHI endeavors to offer access to earth observation-derived maps in Malaysia, bridging the information gap and enhancing the planning, management, and monitoring of coastal and marine ecosystems. This initiative includes the two marine parks in Sabah state, aiming to safeguard ecosystems and promote biodiversity restoration. Please refer to the video below for more information on the initiative:\n\nAnother fascinating area where remotely sensed data is offering solutions to a multitude of problems is urban planning. Challenges such as urban sprawl and growth monitoring, heat island effects and microclimate analysis, disaster preparedness and response facilitation (amongst many others), all become much more manageable with satellite data.\nUtilising Land Surface Temperature (LST) data based on Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station observations from 2018 to 2021, Yin et al. discovered “persistent negative correlations between daytime land surface temperature (LST) and median household income across the Los Angeles metropolitan area” (Yin et al. 2023). These findings are crucial given the projection of more frequent and intense heat waves in the future as it becomes imperative to implement fair mitigation strategies."

    "text": "3.1 Summary\nRemotely sensed images sometimes may be flawed (due to the atmosphere, terrain, sensor, etc.) - there are various types of corrections that can be done and four of them - geometric, atmospheric, orthorectification/topographic, and radiometric calibration - will be discussed below.\n\n3.1.1 Geometric correction\n\nIdentify Ground Control Points (GPS) to align identifiable points within the image with those in a reference dataset.\nDerive geometric transformation coefficients by modeling the coordinates.\nNext, we plot these points and aim to minimize the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (the model with the lowest RMSE will fit best), with Jensen defining a target RMSE value of 0.5.\nRe-sampling the final raster is a must, methods are the following:\n\nNearest Neighbour\nLinear\nCubic\nCubic spine\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic Depiction of Geometric Correction (“Image Processing” n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Atmospheric correction\nAtmospheric correction is necessary when data concerns biophysical parameters as well as when using spectral signatures over time and space.\n\n3.1.2.1 Atmospheric correction types\n\nRelative (to something):\n\nDark object subtraction (DOS) or histogram adjustment: scanning each band to identify the darkest value and then subtracting it from every pixel.\nPseudo-invariant Features (PIFs): assuming brightness pixels linearly relates to a base image - regression per band - modifying the image according to the regression outcome and applying this principle to the rest of the pixels.\n\nAbsolute:\n\nConverting digital brightness values into scaled surface reflectance - allows for comparison of these scaled surface reflectance values globally and is achieved through atmospheric radiative transfer models.\nRequirements: an atmospheric model, local atmospheric visibility, image altitude.\n\nEmpirical line correction:\n\nGoing in situ and using a field spectrometer.\n\n\n\n\n\nA true color composite (bands 4-3-2) of Sentinel-2B image with top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (left) and surface reflectance after atmospheric correction (right) with Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) (“Atmospheric Correction” n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Orthorectification/topographic correction\nOrthorectification is the process of correcting image distortions caused by terrain variations, ensuring accurate geometric representation of Earth’s surface in remote sensing imagery i.e., as if viewed from nadir. It requires sensor geometry and an elevation model.\nFormulas to do this:\n\nCosine correction\nMinnaert correction\nStatistical empirical correction\nC correction\n\n\n\n\n(Setyawan n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Radiometric calibration\nSensors capture image brightness and distribute it as a Digital Number (DN), enabling efficient storage, albeit lacking units. Radiometric calibration is essentially the process if transforming DN to spectral radiance, i.e. the amount of light within a band from a sensor in the field of view (FOV). The process of radiometric calibration is crucial in remote sensing to ensure accurate and consistent measurement of electromagnetic radiation, enabling reliable interpretation and analysis of remote sensing data.\n\n\n3.1.5 Disclaimer - or simply good news?\nRemote sensing products are now provided in a ‘corrected’ format, such as ‘Analysis Ready Data’ (ARD) i.e., there’s no need to apply these corrections manually, however, it is necessary to know how remotely sensed data was created."

    "text": "3.2 Applications\nThe two types of corrections I found most interesting personally were geometric and atmospheric, hence, the applications section will be dedicated to reviewing examples of research papers that have utilised them.\n\n3.2.1 Geometric correction\n(Kim, Son, and Kim 2018) published a study aimed to improve the accuracy of satellite data from ocean color sensors, like the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), by developing a new method for geometric correction. This was a critical gap in research to fill because traditional methods based on ground control points (GCPs) were ineffective in areas where shorelines were absent, presenting a challenge for accurately aligning satellite images. The researchers used a combination of shoreline matching and frequency matching techniques to correct the images. Their findings showed that this new method significantly improved the accuracy of the satellite data, demonstrating the importance of geometric correction in producing reliable and high-quality images for various applications, such as monitoring ocean health and environmental changes.\n\n\n\nGOCI slot imaging sequence (Kim, Son, and Kim 2018).\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Atmospheric correction\n(Sriwongsitanon, Surakit, and Thianpopirug 2011) carried out a study to investigate the impact of atmospheric correction and sampling point density on the precision of remote sensing in assessing lake water clarity. Field experiments were conducted at Bung Boraphet, the largest freshwater lake in Thailand, to gather data on clarity parameters and suspended sediment concentration. By applying atmospheric correction to satellite images, the authors identified substantial effects on the estimated values of water clarity parameters, the accuracy of which is crucial for assessing water quality, monitoring ecosystem health, and informing management decisions to protect freshwater resources."

I am currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in MSc Social and Geographic Data Science (in UCL Geography department once again!).\nOutside of my studies, I am a massive endurance sports enthusiast. Last year I summitted Mount Kilimanjaro (5895m) and this year I decided to take on my first ultramarathon (58km) in May (with a 75km one to follow later this year). Some of my biggest dreams are to tackle a full distance Ironman triathlon and as many races as possible from the UTMB series, however, one step at a time for now!"
