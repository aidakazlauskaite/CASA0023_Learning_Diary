## Summary

This week's content will focus on temperature, specifically the **Urban Heat Island (UHI)** effect. In the following video, the Weather Channel meteorologist Mark Elliot gives a quick introduction into this phenomenon:

Mark gives a quick rundown through all the possible factors that contribute to the UHI effect taking place but (just to recap) the the **two most important contributors to UHI** are:

1. Greater presence of heat-absorbing dark surfaces e.g., pavements, dark rooftops, etc.
2. Decreased vegetation cover, resulting in reduced cooling effects such as evapotranspiration and solar reflection.

So why should we care? The **consequences of the effects of UHI** worsening are seemingly endless (and very well documented in academic literature!):

- Heightened energy usage for cooling purposes
- Elevated levels of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions
- Health hazards including heat-related illnesses and respiratory issues
- Compromised urban livability and quality of life
- Amplified heat-related mortality rates, particularly among vulnerable populations
- Impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity
- Elevated demand for water resources due to higher temperatures and increased evaporation
- Stress on infrastructure and urban services

### Policy

1. **Global**
   - **SDG 11**: aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, focusing on access to adequate housing, transportation, green spaces, and disaster resilience. There's no direct mention of urban heat in the targets, however, it does mention that developing parks and green spaces within urban areas can mitigate the urban heat island effect and enhance air quality in urban environments.
   - **Beat the Heat Handbook**: following 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, this is a guidance and strategies for addressing heat-related challenges in urban areas. It is the first full guide on UHI that suggests initial evaluation and critical considerations including albedo, urban morphology, city planning, vegetation coverage, and thermal mapping incorporating satellite-derived data.
   - **New Urban Agenda**: global agreement adopted by the UN that sets out guidelines and principles for sustainable urban development, addressing challenges such as rapid urbanisation, inequality, and environmental degradation.
   
2. **Local**
   - **Superblocks** = large urban areas designed to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists while limiting vehicle traffic.
   - **Green corridors** = linear stretches of vegetation connecting parks, gardens, and other green spaces throughout urban areas. By providing shaded pathways, enhancing biodiversity, and promoting natural cooling processes, green corridors help mitigate the UHI effect and improve urban resilience to climate change.
   
*Note:* there's a disconnect between global and local policies e.g., Beat the Heat Handbook doesn't actually go into specifics on how their guidelines should be followed and implemented on a smaller scale, hence, this is an issue to be addressed in order for documents and policies discussed in the *Global* section to be effective.

## Applications

In this applications section I chose to focus on excess mortality related to UHI effects. While none of the potential consequences of the UHI effect are to be taken lightly, the positive correlation between heightened sustained temperatures and excess mortality is the most vivid example of just how serious this problem really is.

In the study by @tanUrbanHeatIsland2010 the authors investigated the health impacts of the urban heat island (UHI) effect specifically in Shanghai, China, against the backdrop of anticipated increases in heat waves due to global warming. Through a comprehensive analysis of meteorological data spanning three decades and mortality records from urban, suburban, and exurban areas, the research establishes a direct correlation between the UHI effect and heightened heat-related mortality rates observed in urban regions of Shanghai. This underscores the pressing need for targeted interventions to address the exacerbating effects of UHI on public health, particularly in rapidly urbanising areas facing escalating temperatures and more frequent heat waves induced by climate change.

Another study by @dangGreenSpaceDeaths2018 aimed to quantify heat-related deaths attributable to the urban heat island (UHI) effect in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and explore potential mitigating factors. By estimating district-specific meteorological conditions and analysing mortality data, the research investigated the association between UHI and mortality rates at a finer spatial scale within the city. Yet again, with urbanisation trends and climate change exacerbating UHI effects globally, understanding the impact of UHI on mortality and identifying strategies to alleviate its consequences is crucial for public health planning and urban development in rapidly growing cities like Ho Chi Minh City.
