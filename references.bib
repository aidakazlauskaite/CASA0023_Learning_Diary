  abstract = {Geometric correction is fundamental in producing high quality satellite data products. However, the geometric correction for ocean color sensors, e.g., Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), is challenging because the traditional method based on ground control points (GCPs) cannot be applied when the shoreline is absent. In this study, we develop a hybrid geometric correction method, which applies shoreline matching and frequency matching on slots with shorelines and without shorelines, respectively. Frequency matching has been proposed to estimate the relative orientation between GOCI slots without a shoreline. In this paper, we extend our earlier research for absolute orientation and geometric correction by combining frequency matching results with shoreline matching ones. The proposed method consists of four parts: Initial sensor modeling of slots without shorelines, precise sensor modeling through shoreline matching, relative orientation modeling by frequency matching, and generation of geometric correction results using a combination of the two matching procedures. Initial sensor modeling uses the sensor model equation for GOCI and metadata in order to remove geometric distortion due to the Earth’s rotation and curvature in the slots without shorelines. Precise sensor modeling is performed with shoreline matching and random sample consensus (RANSAC) in the slots with shorelines. Frequency matching computes position shifts for slots without shorelines with respect to the precisely corrected slots with shorelines. GOCI Level 1B scenes are generated by combining the results from shoreline matching and frequency matching. We analyzed the accuracy of shoreline matching alone against that of the combination of shoreline matching and frequency matching. Both methods yielded a similar accuracy of 1.2 km, which supports the idea that frequency matching can replace traditional shoreline matching for slots without visible shorelines.},

  abstract = {Cities worldwide are experiencing record-breaking summer temperatures. Urban environments exacerbate extreme heat, resulting in not only the urban heat island but also intracity variations in heat exposure. Understanding these disparities is crucial to support equitable climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. We found persistent negative correlations between daytime land surface temperature (LST) and median household income across the Los Angeles metropolitan area based on Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station observations from 2018 to 2021. Lower evapotranspiration resulting from the unequal distribution of vegetation cover is a major factor leading to higher LST in low-income neighborhoods. Disparities worsen with higher regional mean surface temperature, with a \$10,000 decrease in income leading to \textasciitilde 0.2°C LST increase at 20°C and up to \textasciitilde 0.7°C at 45°C. With more frequent and intense heat waves projected in the future, equitable mitigation measures, such as increasing surface albedo and tree cover in low-income neighborhoods, are necessary to address these disparities.},
