    "text": "Hi everyone!\nMy name is Aida - I was born and raised in Vilnius, Lithuania, before moving to London to do my undergraduate degree in BSc Economics and Geography at University College London. I am currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in MSc Social and Geographic Data Science (in UCL Geography department once again!).\nOutside of my studies, I am a massive endurance sports enthusiast. Last year I summitted Mount Kilimanjaro (5895m) and this year I decided to take on my first 58km ultramarathon in May (with a 75km one to follow later this year). Some of my biggest dreams are to tackle a full distance Ironman triathlon and as many races as possible from the UTMB series, however, one step at a time for now!"
