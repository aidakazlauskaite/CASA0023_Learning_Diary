# About {.unnumbered}

Hi everyone!

My name is Aida - I was born and raised in Vilnius, Lithuania, before moving to London to do my undergraduate degree in BSc Economics and Geography at University College London. Currently I am pursuing a postgraduate degree in MSc Social and Geographic Data Science (in UCL Geography department once again!). I've not encountered remote sensing either in my studies or work previously, so there's no doubt this will be quite an exciting new subject to learn about.

Outside of my studies, I am a massive endurance sports enthusiast. Last year I summitted Mount Kilimanjaro (5895m) and this year I decided to take on my first ultramarathon (58km) in May (with a 75km one to follow later this year). Some of my biggest dreams are to tackle a full distance Ironman triathlon and as many races as possible from the UTMB series, however, one step at a time for now!
